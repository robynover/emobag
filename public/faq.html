				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				
                <h3>Who are you?</h3>
                <p>My name is Robyn. I'm a freelance web developer in New York City. 
                    I like making things, some of which I might call art. 
                   You can find out more about my work at <a href="http://robynoverstreet.com">RobynOverstreet.com</a>. You can even hire me!</p>

                <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
                <p>I've always kind of liked the term "emotional baggage". Being someone who tends to think in literal terms, I always picture someone carrying a big suitcase when I hear "emotional baggage". One day I amused myself with the concept of an emotional baggage check, like when you check in your luggage at a hotel and they give you a little ticket. As a web geek, when I think of a phrase I find funny, I often check to see if the domain name is taken. To my amazement, no one had snatched up <em>emotionalbagcheck.com</em>. </p>
                
                <h3>Do you work for Grooveshark/ did Grooveshark put you up to this/ are they paying you?</h3>
                <p>No. This is a little side project I made for fun. The site says "Powered by Grooveshark" because that's where I'm getting the songs, and it seems fair to credit them.</p>
                
                <h3>I read someone's baggage, but didn't send them a song. Does that mean they won't get a song at all?</h3>
                <p>They'll still get a song. If you don't carry their baggage, it will make the rounds until someone picks it up.
                (If you don't want to respond to the bag you're shown, try refreshing the page.)</p>
                
                <h3>I submitted some baggage, and I got more than one song back. Is that supposed to happen?</h3>
                <p>Er... technically, no. But I still can't decide if it's a bug or a feature. 
                What do you think? Tell me on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/emobagcheck">@emobagcheck</a></p>
                
                <h3>I saw a post where someone was suicidal or otherwise in danger. Why do you think just sending a song would help them?</h3>
                <p>I don't think that. I never expected to get so many truly desperate messages, and I'm concerned about it. 
                    After a person checks a "bag", they see a link to some suicide prevention resources, 
                    which I've started to aggregate on this <a href="http://emotionalbagcheck.com/resources.php">Resources page</a>. The site is not intended to be a helpline for those in crisis, but I'm doing my best to adapt to situations where people use it as such.</p>

                <h3>Someone sent me a mean song/message. How could you let that happen?!</h3>
                <p>I'm truly sorry that your bag got picked up by someone with cruel intentions. 
                    I have some tactics in place to combat abuse of the site, but unfortunately people are always going to find a way to be a*holes.</p>
                
                <h3>What about trolls? Don't you think the site is going to get destroyed by people with bad intentions?</h3>
                <p>I don't necessarily think that, though I'd be a fool not to acknowledge that it's a possibility. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.</p> 

                <h3>The top 25 songs are all obvious/dumb/bad, so doesn't that mean the song I'll get will be obvious/dumb/bad?</h3>
                <p>The <a href="topsongs.php">top 25 songs</a> represent only about 1% of the total songs sent. 
                    You wouldn't say the top 40 station defines what all music is like, would you? See also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail">the long tail</a>.</p>

                
                <h3>These are all first world problems!</h3>
                <p>If you are looking to work to solve problems of wealth and resource distribution, please don't waste your time with my silly art project! 
                    There are so many projects that are exponentially more important than this one. Here are a few places to start:</p>
