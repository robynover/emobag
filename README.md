Emotional Bag Check
======
The site, emotionalbagcheck.com is no longer live, but a functional demo is available at http://ebc.robynoverstreet.com/ (Posts are not stored and email is not sent.)

EmotionalBagCheck was a site where users could submit, or “check”, their emotional “baggage”, 
a short piece of text about something that had been troubling them, big or small. 
Their message would then be displayed anonymously where another user could choose a song that might provide comfort, 
along with an optional message. The bag-checker would receive an email with the link to the song on Grooveshark. 
I created it for fun, and for the first few months only my friends visited, but then it made the rounds with teens on tumblr.
From there, a few media outlets picked it up and it took off.
